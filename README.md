For the sorting part, you can choose 2 fields that you will validate (instead of doing all 4).
Here's additional information that can help you:
* capital letters are ignored by both filtering and sorting (it works as if all letters were small letters)
* sorting works only in one direction: from low to high, from A to Z, sorting by complexity sorts from low to high
* number of cases uses special formatting, thousands might be expressed as letter "k" (5000 = 5k), millions as M (1200000 = 1.2M), billions as "B" (1580000000 = 1.58B)In order to write the tests you can use any programming language and framework of your choice as long as it is possible to run your tests in UNIX-like environment.
